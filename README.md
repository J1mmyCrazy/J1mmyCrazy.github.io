## Quest 1 – 2D Scene
In this quest I made a pumpkin using a bunch of different shapes and colors. I arranged the shapes to form a stylized pumpkin face instead of just placing them randomly.
The goal of this project was to get comfortable rendering multiple visible shapes and combining them into something recognizable.

## Quest 2 - Animated 2D Scene 
In this quest I made the sharingan eye from a manga/show called Naruto. I added 2 filters being the Gaussian blur and 8-bit. I did add the grayscale filter at first but opted not too becasue it changed the way I wanted to scene too look.
