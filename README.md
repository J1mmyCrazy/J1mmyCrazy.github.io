## Name of 3 classmates and skill or interest
- **Andrew**: One interest they have is game development. 
- **Raymond**: One interest they have is in visuals.
- **Diego**: One interest they have in in the visual aspect of video games.

## A place I would like to visit and why
I would like to go to a GDC. Every year I have wanted to go there was always some conflict in the way.

## Quest 1 – 2D Scene
In this quest I made a pumpkin using a bunch of different shapes and colors. I arranged the shapes to form a stylized pumpkin face instead of just placing them randomly.
The goal of this project was to get comfortable rendering multiple visible shapes and combining them into something recognizable.

## Quest 2 - Animated 2D Scene 
In this quest I made the sharingan eye from a manga/show called Naruto. I added 2 filters being the Gaussian blur and 8-bit. I did add the grayscale filter at first but opted not too becasue it changed the way I wanted to scene too look. 

## Quest 3 - Interactive 2D Scene
(1 pt) Game of Life grid updated using a compute shader
(1 pt) Grid is at least 256×256 and randomly initialized
(1 pt) Keyboard input to pause/resume and reset
(1 pt) Keyboard input to speed up / slow down
(1 pt) 2D camera movement with keyboard (pan)
(1 pt) 2D camera zoom in/out
(1 pt) On-screen text instructions (HUD)
(1 pt) FPS text toggle (HUD)
(1 pt) Cells are rendered with a fragment shader using distinct colors

## Quest 4 – Dynamic Particle Scene
(1 pt) Particle system physics implemented using a compute shader
(1 pt) Forces applied to particles (buoyancy, wind, and gravity)
(1 pt) Particle lifespan with respawning and enforced maximum particle count
(1 pt) Particle positions updated from velocity each frame
(1 pt) Boundary wrap-around applied to particles leaving the screen
(1 pt) Mouse interaction used to attract particles in real time
(1 pt) Recognizable particle effects created (fire + rainbow sparks)
(1 pt) Non-linear interpolation applied to particle alpha fade
(1 pt) Scene composed of two simultaneous particle effects
(1 pt) Runs interactively with large particle counts (30,000+ total)
